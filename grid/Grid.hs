-- Square represents a single point on the grid. A Square may be one of four things:
-- - Open: An unvisited open space that can be entered with cost 1.
-- - Visited: A visited open space that should not be explored again
-- - onPath: A node on the shortest path from source to target
-- - Blocked: An closed space that cannot be entered.
-- - Start: The starting point. There should only be one per grid!
-- - Finish: The target endpoint. There should only be one per grid!
